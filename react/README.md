import React from 'react'; // import react package

import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'; // connect react with web browser dom

why className? not reserved words,but React use the vanila javascript, so, document.getElementById('something').className+="new-class-name".

- className can just used in the original HTML tag, rather than the self-built tag
- className should search from the root location, also where the first tag comes out
- props are immutable and unchangable
