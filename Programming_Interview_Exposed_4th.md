## Programming_Interview_Exposed_4th

##### refer by prof. Mike Bailey

#### KNOW YOURSELF

- Do you want long-term or short-term projects? Some programmers crave change, spending a few months at most on each project. If you like short-term projects and don’t mind traveling, a gig with a consulting company might make more sense than a more conventional corporate job.
- Does management interest you? Some coders have a long-term goal to become a manager, but others shiver at the very thought. If management is your goal, you need to develop lead- ership skills and demonstrate that you can manage the human parts of the software development equation as well as the technical pieces. If management is not your goal, look for companies with good technical career paths, so you’re not forced to manage people to be promoted. (You still need leadership skills to get promoted no matter which career path you choose, but leadership skills are separate from people-management skills.)
- Do you want to work for a big company? Working at big companies has advantages and disadvantages. For example, a large company may offer more job stability (although layoffs during downturns are common) and some kind of career path. It may also have a name brand that nontechies recognize. On the other hand, you may feel stifled by the bureaucracy, rigidness, and intracompany rivalry often found in bigger companies.
- Don’t bother with certifications. The authors of this book believe that programming certificates are of limited value because very few such jobs require certification. Additionally, almost none of the programmers at the top employers have formal programming certificates, and these are the people interviewing/evaluating you. Instead of spending time getting one of the certifications, we suggest working on some of the other recommendations here (side projects, school).
- Recruiters and hiring committees like to see that you have multiple accomplishments—a pattern of getting things done.

#### The Job Application Process

- The first step to getting a job is to find and make contact with companies you’re interested in working for. Although referrals are the best way to land a job, you can also work with headhunters or contact a company directly.
- Small companies
  - One good way to find these companies is to ask friends and acquaintances if they know of startups that are hiring.
  - You can use some sites, such as LinkedIn, to search for people by profession within a region. Most people on these sites list the name of their company, so you can build a list of companies in a particular region by going through the results of this search. This can be laborious, but part of the payoff is that if you can’t find these companies any other way, neither can anyone else, so you’re likely to be competing with fewer applicants.
- Referrals are the best way to find a job. Tell all your friends about what kind of job you’re looking for. Even if they don’t work for the kinds of companies that might hire you, they may know people who do. 
- When you work with headhunters, you must understand their motivation: headhunters are paid only when an applicant they’ve referred is hired. 
- The job description that the headhunter sends you is often copied verbatim from the company’s website, so by pasting it into your favorite search engine you can often find the original job listing.
- Job fairs are an easy way to learn about and make contact with a lot of companies without much effort.
- Several sites exist where you “face-off” against bots and other candidates in coding contests, including TopCoder, HackerRank, and CodeWars. These sites can be an important part of your online profile, and they are also a great source for finding jobs. If you’re successful on these sites, you’ll find job offers coming your way because employers want the best programmers, and this is a convenient way to demonstrate your prowess.
- The company usually takes you out for lunch midway through your interview day. A free lunch at a nice restaurant or even at the company cafeteria is certainly enjoyable, but don’t let your guard down completely. If you make a negative impression at lunch, you may lose your offer. Be polite, and avoid alcohol and messy foods.
- At the end of the day, you may meet with the boss; if the boss spends a lot of time trying to sell you on working for the company, it’s a pretty strong indication that you’ve done well in your interviews and an offer will follow.
- Job applicants traditionally wear suits to interviews. Most tech companies, though, are business casual—or even just casual. The running joke at some of these companies is that the only people who wear suits are job candidates and salespeople.
- After the decision is made to give you an offer, the recruiter’s job is to do everything necessary to get you to accept the offer at the lowest possible salary. 
- Negotiating Your Salary
  - Remember that the best time to get more money is before you accept the job. When you’re an employee, the company holds the power and salary increases are typically much smaller and harder to come by.
- When an offer is made, don’t accept it immediately. Give yourself time to consider it. Look over the offer, and try to negotiate a better deal because most offers aren’t fixed in stone, no matter what the recruiter says. After accepting a job offer, be sure to contact anyone else who has made you an offer to thank them for their interest in you.

#### Phone Screens by Software Engineers

  - For example, it’s not uncom- mon for candidates to claim proficiency in every programming language they’ve ever used, even those used only once for a school assignment.
  - Don’t be surprised or offended by the apparent simplicity of some of the questions. Remember, they’re designed to quickly weed out the exaggerators and liars.

#### Approaches to Programming Problems

  - Coding questions are the heart of the process that most computer and software companies use to decide who to hire. How a candidate performs during the programming interviews is the main determinant of whether an offer is made.
  - The programming questions are generally difficult. If everyone (or even most people) answered a particular question quickly, companies would stop asking it because it wouldn’t tell them anything about the applicants. Many of the questions are designed to take up to an hour to solve, so don’t get frustrated if you don’t see the answer right away. It’s not unusual for each interviewer to explore just a single question.
  - These problems are hard! Some of the questions are designed to see how you handle a problem when you don’t immediately see the solution.
  - Generally, you are asked to write a function or method, but sometimes you need to write a class definition or a sequence of related code modules. In any case, you write code, either in an actual programming language or in some form of pseudocode. (The closer you can get to actual working code, the better.)
  - Interactivity Is Key.
    - Keep talking! Always explain what you are doing. Otherwise, the inter- viewer has no way of knowing how you tackle complex programming problems.
    - Explain what you are doing to your interviewer before and while coding the solution. Keep talking!
    - Make sure you check your code for all error and special cases, especially boundary conditions. 
    - Try an example, and check all error and special cases.
  - One sign that you may be off track is if you find yourself writing too much code. Almost all interview coding questions have short answers. You rarely need to write more than 30 lines of code and almost never more than 50. If you start writing a lot of code, you may be heading in the wrong direction.
  - If asked to comment on the performance of a solution, a Big-O runtime analysis is usually sufficient. Algorithms that run in constant, logarithmic, linear, or quasilinear time are preferred. You should also be prepared to comment on the memory footprint of an algorithm.

#### Linked Lists

  - The simplicity of linked list questions appeals to interviewers who want to present at least two or three problems over the course of a 1-hour interview, because they must give you problems that you can be reasonably expected to solve in only 20 to 30 minutes. You can write a rela- tively complete implementation of a linked list in less than 10 minutes, leaving you plenty of time to solve the problem. In contrast, it might take you most of the interview period to imple- ment a more complex data structure such as a hash table. 
  - When interviewers say “linked list” they generally mean a linear singly linked list.

## Don’t lose faith and trust your preparation

#### Nontechnical questions

- are important! Treat them that way.
- Emphasize any similar and relevant experience that makes you a strong candidate.
- Everyone likes hearing the word team—everyone.
- If you’re asked this question by a technical interviewer, watch out! If you answer this question poorly, you won’t get an offer. These interviewers ask this question partly to discover your goals and ambitions. If you want to do something different from the available job, your interviewer will prob- ably decide that you should look for a different job.
- “What Do You Want to Do?”
  - "I want to do web programming so that I can show my work to my friends. I’m hoping to do this at a startup like yours where my web server experience can help the company grow."
  - Sometimes, you may not know what specific job you’re interviewing for. Some companies hire soft- ware engineers and match them to jobs after they’ve been hired. In these cases, you can always fall back on describing the company you’re applying to as the ideal company for you. This will be easier and more effective if you’ve done at least a little bit of research about the company before your interview—the Internet is your friend! 
  - **Make sure your answer never sounds like you’d be happy to take any sort of job the company would be willing to offer. This sort of response virtu- ally guarantees nothing more than a thank-you-for-coming-in letter.**
  - If you know exactly what you want to do and wouldn’t accept any other kind of job, don’t talk yourself up for a job you’d never accept. Communicating specifically about what you are and aren’t interested in may prevent you from getting some job offers, but those offers wouldn’t be jobs that you want. One advantage to expressing exactly what you want to do is that it may give your inter- viewers a chance to switch gears—even if you don’t begin the day interviewing with a group that interests you, you may end the day interviewing with such a group.
  - it’s a good opportunity to mention that you want to work with a great team—don’t pass it up. Make sure that being a member of a great team comes across as one of your priorities.
- Acknowledge that there are some tasks for which your favorite language is a poor choice. Mention that you are familiar with a range of languages and that you believe that no one language is a uni- versal solution. It’s important to pick the best tool for the job.
This advice holds for other “favorites” questions, such as “What is your favorite kind of computer?” or “What is your favorite operating system?”
- “What Salary Are You Expecting?”
  - It is generally considered wise to put this question off as long as possible. It is not in your interest to discuss numbers until you’ve convinced the potential employer of your value. If they really like you, generally, any remotely reasonable sal- ary could be possible. If you can’t escape this question in the early stages of an interview, try to give a range of salaries with the amount that you want at the low end. This gives you good bargaining room later.
  - **Do your homework.** If you find that people with similar jobs and levels of experience in your area make $80,000–$95,000 a year, you’re probably not going to make $120,000 a year. Make sure your salary expectations are realistic.
  - **Never undersell yourself.** If you’re looking for an annual salary of $80,000, don’t tell an employer that you’re looking for approximately $70,000 a year with the hope that the employer will, for some reason, offer more. If you lowball yourself, an employer will happily hire you at the lower salary. If you say a salary higher than an employer can, or will pay, the worst they’ll usually say is something like, “We can’t get that high. Is it still worth talking?” They won’t just reject you outright.
  - **Consider carefully what you want in a total compensation package.** You may be graduat- ing from college and want a signing bonus to offset the costs of finding an apartment, mov- ing, and placing deposits. Or you may be looking to join a startup offering generous stock options and slightly lower salaries. In any case, figure out exactly what you’re looking for in terms of bonuses, benefits, stock options, and salary.
  - **The range may be about what you expected.** In this case, you can usually gain a slightly higher salary with a simple technique. Start by not being too excited—stay cool. Next, say that you had a similar but slightly higher range in mind, setting your minimum at the maximum of the offered range. For example, if the employer says, “We’re expecting to pay $70,000 to $75,000,” you should respond, “That seems about right. I’m looking to make $75,000 to $80,000 and hoping for the high end of that range.” Finally, negotiate in a pro- fessional manner until you agree on a number with the interviewer; you’ll probably receive an offer between $73,000 and $78,000.
  - **The negotiator may not answer your question.** They may give a response such as “We have a wide range of salaries depending on the applicant. What were you expecting?” This response is actually quite favorable because it indicates that they have the authority to pay you a com- petitive salary. The response shows that the negotiator is willing to negotiate, but it also indi- cates that you may be subject to some hardball negotiating skills.
  - Bearing in mind that negotiation will follow, respond with one number, the high end of your range. This gives you room to negotiate and still receive a favorable offer. For example, if you’re expecting between $75,000 and $80,000, say, “I’m expecting $80,000 a year.” Presenting it like this leaves the other negotiator less room to lowball you than if you give a range. Avoid weaker expressions like “I’m hoping for....” or “I’d really like....” The negotia- tor may accept your number, or may try to negotiate a slightly lower salary. If you remain professional and negotiate carefully, your final salary should fall within your desired range.
  - The offer may be less than you expected. This is the most difficult position for negotiations, but you still may be able to get what you want. Reemphasize your skills and state the salary range you were expecting. For example, if you were offered a salary of $55,000 but were expecting $70,000, you may say, “I have to admit I’m a little disappointed with that offer. Given my extensive experience with web development and the contributions I can make to this company, I’m expecting a salary of $70,000.”
